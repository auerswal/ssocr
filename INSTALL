Building and Installing
-----------------------
To build ssocr, type:

    make

You can use ssocr from the directory you built it, no installation required.
If you want to install it to your system, type:

    make install

To change the default install location of /usr/local to /usr, type:

    make PREFIX=/usr install

You have to keep track of the installed files yourself, if you want to
remove them later on.

If you prefer to install a .deb package for easier removal, you can
build a .deb package by typing:

    make selfdeb

Prerequisites
-------------
- A system sufficiently compatible to POSIX and GNU.
- POSIX utilities: chmod, printf, sh, sed (or compatible)
- GNU utilities: date, gzip, install, tar (or compatible)
- Other utilities: bzip2
- Imlib2 shared library and development headers. On a Debian or Ubuntu system
  they are provided by the packages libimlib2 and libimlib2-dev.
  On Mac OS X you can use 'brew' to install Imlib2: brew install imlib2
  (see https://brew.sh/)
- imlib2-config (part of libimlib2-dev on Debian or Ubuntu)
- Imlib2 requires the X11/Xlib.h header and links against some X11 libraries,
  at least on GNU/Linux with X11 GUI, thus X11 shared libraries and development
  headers are required for ssocr, too, although ssocr does not use X11 itself
- Build tools, e.g. build-essential on a Debian (or Ubuntu) system.
- To build a .deb package, you probably need the debhelper package.
- To create an HTML version of the man page, you need rman.

Additional Makefile Targets
---------------------------
- clean:              remove generated files except packages
- distclean:          remove all generated files
- tar:                create a bzip2 compressed tar-ball of the sources for
                      distribution
- ssocr-manpage.html: create HTML version of man page
- selfdeb:            create a package file in .deb format that can be
                      installed on Debian-like distributions

Platform Specifics
------------------
- I am testing on GNU/Linux only
- I am testing with GCC only
- On Windows, you may need to rename the binary from ssocr to ssocr.exe
- On macOS, you may need to specify the X11 include path manually.
  The following have been reported as working on macOS at some time:
  - make CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/X11/include
  - make CPPFLAGS=-I/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX11.3.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/Tk.framework/Versions/8.5/Headers/

C Compiler Problems:
--------------------
Some users have reported problems with their C compilers.  If you are not
using a stable release version of GCC, you may need to disable security
features supposed to be provided by the C compiler, but broken in your
specific compiler version.  To do this, remove the following from the
CFLAGS definition in the Makefile:

    -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -fstack-protector-all

If you need to do this to compile ssocr, please consider reporting the issue
to your source for your C compiler (e.g., vendor or distribution).

Another problem can be the introduction of new compiler warnings.  Some of
those are prone to false positives, and this problem does occur for stable
GCC releases as well.  Because ssocr's CFLAGS include both options -Werror
and -pedantic-errors, false positives will break compilation of ssocr.
To work around this problem, you can remove both of these options from
the CFLAGS definition in the Makefile:

    -Werror -pedantic-errors

If you suspect that your C compiler has problems with the ssocr source code,
you can use the minimal CFLAGS definition given below:

    CFLAGS := $(shell imlib2-config --cflags)

You can do this by commenting out the default CFLAGS definition and removing
the comment sign in front of the minimal CFLAGS definition in the Makefile.

You can get the current ssocr version from the official ssocr website:

Third Party Packages
--------------------
There exist third party packaging efforts for e.g. GNU/Linux distributions
and FreeBSD. Thus you can search the packaging system of your distribution
for an ssocr package.
