Building and Installing
-----------------------
To build ssocr, type:

    make

You can use ssocr from the directory you build it, no installation required.
If you want to install it to your system, type:

    make install

To change the default install location of /usr/local to /usr, type:

    make PREFIX=/usr install

You have to keep track of the installed files yourself, if you want to
remove them later on.

If you prefer to install a .deb package for easier removal, you can
build a .deb package by typing:

    make selfdeb

Prerequisites
-------------
- A system sufficiently compatible to POSIX and GNU.
- POSIX utilities: chmod, printf, sh, sed (or compatible)
- GNU utilities: date, gzip, install, tar (or compatible)
- Other utilities: bzip2
- Imlib2 shared library and development headers. On a Debian or Ubuntu system
  they are provided by the packages libimlib2 and libimlib2-dev.
  On Mac OS X you can use 'brew' to install Imlib2: brew install imlib2
  (see http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/)
- imlib2-config (part of libimlib2-dev on Debian or Ubuntu)
- Build tools, e.g. build-essential on a Debian (or Ubuntu) system.
- To build a .deb package, you probably need the debhelper package.
- To create an HTML version of the man page, you need rman.

Additional Makefile Targets
---------------------------
- clean:              remove generated files except packages
- distclean:          remove all generated files
- tar:                create a bzip2 compressed tar-ball of the sources for
                      distribution
- ssocr-manpage.html: create HTML version of man page
- selfdeb:            create a package file in .deb format that can be
                      installed on Debian-like distributions

Platform Specifics
------------------
- I am testing on GNU/Linux only
- You may need to rename the binary from ssocr to ssocr.exe to use it on Windows
- You may need to specify the X11 include path manually on macOS, using e.g.
  make CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/X11/include

Website
-------
You can get the current ssocr version from the official ssocr website:

Third Party Packages
--------------------
There exist third party packaging efforts for e.g. GNU/Linux distributions
and FreeBSD. Thus you can search the packaging system of your distribution
for an ssocr package.
