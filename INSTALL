Building and Installing
-----------------------
To build ssocr, type:

make

You can use ssocr from the directory you build it, no installation required.
If you want to install it to your system, type:

make install

To change the default install location of /usr/local to /usr, type:

make PREFIX=/usr install

You have to keep track of the installed files yourself, if you want to
remove them later on. If you prefer to install a .deb package for easier
removal, you can build a .deb package by typing:

make deb

Prerequisites
-------------
- Imlib2 shared library and development headers. On a Debian or Ubuntu system
  they are provided by the packages libimlib2 and libimlib2-dev.
  On Mac OS X you can use 'brew' to install Imlib2: brew install imlib2
  (see http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/)
- Build tools, e.g. build-essential on a Debian (or Ubuntu) system.
- To build a .deb package, you probably need the debhelper package.
- To create an HTML version of the man page, you need rman.

Additional Makefile targets
---------------------------
- clean:              remove generated files
- tar:                create a tar-ball of the sources for distribution
- ssocr-manpage.html: create HTML version of man page
